PERSONAL FINANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This program is a simple **Finance Manager** application built using Java Swing, which helps users calculate their monthly savings. 
It provides input fields for the user to enter their monthly income, expenses, and investments.
Based on this data, clicking the "Calculate Savings" button computes and displays the remaining savings after deducting expenses and investments from the income.
The interface includes additional buttons to clear all fields or exit the application. 
A non-editable text area displays the results, including a breakdown of inputs and the calculated savings.
The program ensures basic error handling, showing an error message if invalid input is entered, and uses a straightforward `FlowLayout` for organizing components in a user-friendly manner.
